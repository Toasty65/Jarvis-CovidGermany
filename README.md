# Jarvis-CovidGermany

<h1> Disclaimer </h1>
	<p>
  		The use of this bot only makes sense for users who also live in Germany, since it only displays infection statistics from Germany and the bot itself also uses the German language
	</p>
    
<h1> Description </h1>
	<p>
  		This is a bot that can display numbers of Covid-19 infection incidence depending on the federal state. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b><i>How does the whole thing work?</i></b>
<br/>
  Well, it is relatively simple. The Robert Koch Institute provides an <a href="https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ef4b445a53c1406892257fe63129a8ea_0/about">API</a> that provides daily updated Corona numbers. The bot sends a request to this API, receives an answer and grabs the numbers that are of interest or relevance. Afterwards everything is packed into an embed and sent.
<br/>
<br/>
  <b>This also means that this bot will not read and store / process any data from you.</b>
<br/>
<br/>
  If you are interested you can have a look at the source code.
